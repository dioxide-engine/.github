> This page is designed to organize everything related to the project in a structured and product-ready way. Even though the project is at a very early stage, it is going to be very big and therefore organization is very important to me.

Dioxide is an **experimental framework** for creating applications, especially games, which, rather than being a sandbox, is designed to fit the app perfectly and provide a programming rather than scripting experience. It should support geometrically defined assets like vector graphics, is built on top of the Vulkan graphics API, and can be built for Windows, macOS, Linux, Android, and iOS.

## Key features
* 2D & 3D rendering
* Geometrically defined assets (3D vector graphics)
* Modules to enable online services support
* Cross-platform (Desktop & Mobile)
* High performance through language capabilities
* Fully-fledged code editor for writing, analyzing & auto-completing code as well as creating assets
* **Easy** build tool uses YAML like Dart's pubspec
## Fundamental concept
Unreal is a great tool for creating games. But it is a toolbox that turns the development process into design and scripting instead of programming. The same applies to Unity. Also, they are huge. Size isn’t necessarily a problem, but think about newcomers and indie solo developers. They want a way of creating that is fun and high-yielding. Is Unreal, etc., that? I would say that their system isn’t that great, and because of this, I'm committed to making an alternative.

The game engine fits perfectly with my expectations of game-empowering software, more of an API instead of a sandbox. Also, the project began with the idea of making a 3D vector graphics-supporting game engine as an experiment.

### Trying to be modern
If the Carbon Language succeeds, I plan to use it to create the engine. I have great hopes that they will create the modern low-level language I have been waiting for. Modern principles directly baked into the language sound great to me, and more importantly: clean!

## Current
Currently, I am creating the Flutter application base that is needed and planning the structure. After that, I will start to create the editor itself as well as the toolbox, and later the engine. All of this will take so much time that the Carbon language will be ready (based on Carbon's predictions).
